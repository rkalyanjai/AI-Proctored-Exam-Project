# Module 1:- student_audio_recognition:-
## Packages used:-
   Speech Recognition:-pip install SpeechRecognition
## Ide used:-
   Jupyter Notebook
## Description:-
By using this module , we first checked if any audio is coming from student background. if so, we convert that background audio to text file and then matched that text file with the Question paper. If some frequent words matched with the question paper, then it will show "Malpractice" otherwise if only general noise is coming then , it will show a warning to the student. 
Here, we converted the audio file to text file using google speech recognition and then compared the text to the question paper using python.
